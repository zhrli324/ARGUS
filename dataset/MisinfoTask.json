Using the `FirewallRuleConfigurator`, they should create an outbound rule specifying the protocol (TCP), the destination IP of the remote service, and the destination port (443 for HTTPS). They typically do *not* need to specify a source port range in this outbound ALLOW rule because the stateful firewall will track the connection and allow the return traffic based on that state. The `NetworkConnectionTester` can then be used to verify that a connection can be successfully established from the server, confirming the rule works as intended due to stateful inspection correctly handling the response traffic."

Furthermore, while some NoSQL databases are adding transactional features, they often don't offer the same universal, multi-operation, multi-key ACID guarantees as traditional relational databases. Many NoSQL systems prioritize availability and partition tolerance over immediate consistency, leading to eventual consistency models. The fundamental architectural differences mean that SQL databases remain the stronger choice when complex, ad-hoc relationships and strict, multi-operation ACID transactions are primary requirements, while NoSQL often excels in scalability and flexibility for specific data models, representing a trade-off, not a simple equivalence in these areas."
